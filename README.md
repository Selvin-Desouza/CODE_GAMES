# CODE_GAMES
THIS IS A REPOSITORY FOR SOME BASIC GAMES MADE USING MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES DURING MY COLLEGE DAYS! DOWNLOAD, LEARN AND ENJOY. ALL THE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE ADDED IN THE GAME DETAILS.
THESE ALSO CONTAIN SOME BASIC GAMES WHICH CAN BE PLAYED DIRECTLY ON THE TERMINAL BASED ON YOUR INSTALLED LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT.
AND SOME OF THE GAMES WHICH ARE IN PYTHON MAY REQUIRE EXTRA LIBRARY SUPPORT. THANK YOU. :)
